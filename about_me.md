> A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyse a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects. - Robert A. Heinlein, _Time Enough for Love_

I am currently majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics and the Life Sciences at Ahmedabad University, Ahmedabad, India.

As an aspiring autodidact polymath, I have a wide range of interests, particularly in the subjects I pursue at university.

The breadth of my interests does not warrant a list of topics that interest me, instead you can get a sense of them through the [short blogs](https://kshitij-shekhar.github.io/), and my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/kshitij-shekhar).
